# Download Plot and Play with Earthquakes

This repository has been inpired by the recent volcanic eruption in La Palma (Canary Islands).

Here I will be adding a series of script to download, plot and make gifs of earthquakes locations, cumulative magnitude, SO2 evolution, ....
### The files codes do:
1. Authomatic download of the earthquakes data from the IGN (Spain) earthquake repository https://www.ign.es/web/ign/portal/sis-catalogo-terremotos
2. Transformation from Lat Lon to UTM projection
3. Plot an animated 2D scatter plot through time using Plotly
4. Plot subplot with SO2 evolution and quanlitative heatmap of the cumulative earthquake magnitude. SO2 data is coming from the daily PEVOLCA reports http://info.igme.es/eventos/Erupcion-volcanica-la-palma/pevolca 
5. Plot a 3D interactive plot of the seismicity
6. Making an animated GIF with the daily seismicity

... and much more will come
